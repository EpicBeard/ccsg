        The thing about consulting that makes us excited about each project we do is that it makes
        a difference. Differences can be such things as helping save a career exposed to the judicial process, it can be
        a classroom of students leaving with new skills and plans for future performance, it can be the action plan
        associated with a program assessment that, once implemented, will improve safety and job performance. All are
        motivators to provide services that matter and help shape the future of correctional program success. I started
        doing projects on my own time before retirement. Since that time there have many more. Each one is new, full of
        variety, and provides promise of an important contribution. All this keeps us going and introduces partnerships
        that add so much more to the project satisfaction. It is important to understand there is little I have done in consulting
        work without partnering others in effective relationships on each project. My first partner is my wife Vickie who
        is an officer in the corporation and a very competent adviser. I work with the best in the business and the involvement
        is tailored to the conditions of each project. Below are examples of many that I have joined forces with on specific projects.
